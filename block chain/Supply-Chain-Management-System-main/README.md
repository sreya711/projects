# Supply Chain Management System

A supply chain system which is transparent and lets clients make bids which is secret until all the bidders have made their mid. After the bids are submitted the system automatically distributes the items and moves ahead with the process.

### Follow the below mentioned steps and commands to run the Supply Chain Management System:

Migrate to the directory ```/src/backend/contracts```. 

The ```SupplyChain.sol``` contract contains the code for the Supply Chain Management System

Deploy the contract in a ```truffle``` environment. You can setup ```truffle``` using https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/how-to/install/ and ```ganache``` using https://trufflesuite.com/docs/ganache/quickstart/

Once deployed you need to copy the supply chain contract address and paste it to ```Line 46``` of ```App.js``` file.

Migrate to the root directory to start the react server to use the contract funtionality with the front-end.

Run command ```npm run start```

To integrate the react server with the blockchain contracts use ```Metamask``` as a provider. Import the wallets generated by ```ganache``` in your ```Metamask``` wallet and perform transactions with it.
