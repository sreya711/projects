colab was used for the implementation
QUESTION-1
 i used a 3 layer model. it took 5 mins to run with f1_score as 0.79.
 epochs=50, batch_size=80

QUESTION-2
I used a cat image( being used from the drive)
layers 1 and 5 and printed in the notebook
execution time: 14secs

QUESTION-3
a-) 
on just increasisng the cnn layer by 1 :
more faetures seem to be able to be detected
f1-score = 0.8014200249765828
on just increasisng the mlp layer by 1 :
overfittibng might have occured
f1-score = 0.7833344059866779

total execution time= 12mins

b)-)i increased the size
f1-scor = 0.8075156208761247
execution time= 8mins

c)-)on not using the dropout-
f1_score = 0.7299340911541697
execution time = 4mins

d)-) the final layers are more pixeled and more in number compared to the initial layers.

f)-) on increaseing the batch size, the execution time decreases and the accuracy decreases, 
    on incereasing the epoch, the execution time increases and the accuracy increases.


QUESTION -4
CODE IS DONE...
execution took 13mins
