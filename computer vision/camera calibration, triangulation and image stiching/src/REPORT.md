the error obtained is:
0.17913868890245974

was done with 2000 random computaions with 7 point pairs out of 20 total combinations.

question-3
statistical optimal solution is done. world points of the camera were found with respect to all the 7 image point pairs and their average is taken as the final coordinate:
[0.99934882 0.71292397 0.42740885 1.        ]

question-4
SIFT method was used.
the outputs can be seen in the result file.
